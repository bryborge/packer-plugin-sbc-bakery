# Single-Board Computer (SBC) Bakery

A [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) plugin for baking ARM-based Operating System (OS) images for Single-Board Compute (SBC) modules.

**Note:** This project is very much a work-in-progress. Please see [packer-builder-arm](https://github.com/mkaczanowski/packer-builder-arm), which is the original inspiration for this work.
